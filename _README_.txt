The example files for the SAP2000 OAPI tutorial with VBA are
in this github repository.  The files are stored in the form
of a ".bas" file, which is how MS Excel stores exported
VBA modules.  In order to use these files, follow these steps:

1. Within Excel, open the Visual Basic editor
2. In the project browser, right click and press "import file"
3. Navigate to the ".bas" file of interest and then open it
4. The module containing the macro should now appear in
your project browser

Good luck!
